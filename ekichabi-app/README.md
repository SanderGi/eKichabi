# ekichabi-mobile-client

This is the repository for eKichabi v2.0, an Android application for retrieving contact information for enterprises in rural Tanzania. Our app is built in Java 11.0.2 with a minimum Android SDK of 21. We follow a Model-View-ViewModel pattern, with a central Activity, a central ViewModel, and a variety of Fragments and corresponding supporting classes. 

The app was modified from the Capstone project by Berensohn et al. They licensed it under the [BSD license](https://comotion.uw.edu/licensing/open-source/). For more context on the project, including user study information and implementation details, please see the [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13F6qzRdZNvX4hypXnR0bkxy-Ih9gz18M/view?usp=sharing).
